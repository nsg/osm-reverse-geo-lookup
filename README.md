# OSM Reverse GEO Lookup

Generate a filtered down database from OSM data that can be used for reverse geo lookups.

## Performance

Speed is not important here because this is a batch process that can be executed unattended. The freshness of this data is not that important either. Memory usage can be a problem if we process to large chunks of the world.
